# You Only Mine Once: the Minecraft Server where you Really Shouldn't Die

> Editor's Note: Nobody ever joined this server, for reasons that are, perhaps, obvious in hindsight.

I used to play a lot of Minecraft. At one point, my name could be found in the [early players list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/m9qpl/list_of_minecrafts_early_players/) that was distributed with certain versions of the game. Being implemented in Java, it was one of the few commercial games available for Linux at the time, and it was quite easy to mod by cramming things into its JAR file.

## The State of the Game

Lately, I haven't been playing as much. Partly, this is because I feel [let down](https://twitter.com/notch/status/1047867188332453889) by the [game's creator](https://twitter.com/notch/status/1101794469060337664), who just won't stop saying mean things. Part of it is that I feel even more let down by the current steward of the game, Microsoft (proud host of this blog!), who, having bought the game, decided to completely reimplement it in native code, release on [every platform they could find **except** Linux](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Edition#Platform_differences), and start turning it into a microtransaction hell of DLC and [Minecraft Coins](https://beta.support.xbox.com/help/games-apps/game-titles/minecraft-marketplace-faq):

But since Microsoft seems to think that the worldwide popularity that draws people into the Minecraft franchise depends on the modding community from the original Java version of the game, and also since you should never miss an opportunity to sell someone the same thing twice, they're continuing to keep around and update what is now **Minecraft: Java Edition**.

## Minecraft Servers Today

But even there, most of the available servers are just **independent** microtransaction hells, which you find via server lists that are page after page of these frenetic animated banners promising every game mode, plugin, and feature that has ever been invented. Here's one that sponsored itself to the top of [MinecraftServers.org](https://minecraftservers.org/):

[![MineSuperior! Free WorldEdit! Some other stuff that goes by too fast to read!](images/011/banner.gif)](https://minesuperior.com/)

On their store, you can buy, among a dizzying array of other options, a selection of ostensibly deeply discounted "money boosters" for their prison game mode:

![Just some of MineSuperior's wares](images/011/store.png)

You can also [buy your way around a ban](https://store.minesuperior.net/category/406713) for the low low price of $19.99. And if you don't want to spend real money, you can also cast your vote in favor of this server as the best server, once a day, on each of several server list web sites, [in exchange for in-game rewards](https://minesuperior.com/threads/minesuperior-voting-links.25332/).

I'm picking on the good folks at MineSuperior here, where I've never played and which I'm sure is very fun, but their competitors aren't meaningfully different in their business tactics. The net result of this is that the directories you would use to find places to play, below their sponsored listings, are effectively sorting servers by

1. how many players they already have, and
2. how effectively they can bribe those players into clicking vote buttons.

This is why, when *I'm* looking for a place to play Minecraft, I usually start from the last page.

## What I'm Doing About It

This month, when I got around to dusting off Minecraft, I figured I would try and put something together to oppose these trends. Rather than a frenetic microtransaction hell for as many easily manipulated children as possible, only vaguely recognizable as Minecraft, I've put together a **highly exclusive vanilla macro-transaction paradise for adults with steady dispositions**. Valued readers, I give you...

[![You Only Mine Once: Premium Hardcore Permadeath Minecraft](/images/011/yomo.png)](https://YouOnlyMineOnce.com)
(Network Jesus, please forgive me for referring to a hostname as an IP. That's what all the Minecraft kids are doing these days.)

[*You Only Mine Once*](https://YouOnlyMineOnce.com) is a pay-to-play, premium Minecraft server, and it is **expensive**. Prospective players must fork over $250.00 USD, *in advance*, to even be allowed in to *see* the server. But, there's no monthly fee to have to cancel, no ads for microtransaction skill boost present explosions or any other such nonsense, and no institutionalized electoral fraud.

On the server, the game that you play is Minecraft. Normal-ass normal Minecraft. Not Skyblock, or town-recruitment, or pretend-to-be-in-jail-because-prisons-are-a-fun-game-and-not-a-stain-on-the-moral-character-of-our-society. Minecraft.

But the real defining feature of *You Only Mine Once*, from whence it gets its name, is that, when you die, **you will be permanently banned**. This isn't the first time permadeath [has been tried](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers-java-edition/pc-servers/694719-perm-ban-on-death-server), and Minecraft's built-in [Hardcore Mode](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hardcore) in multiplayer can automatically pop players into spectator mode when they die. However, I'm hoping that the hefty entrance fee on this project will not only allow the server to remain funded for longer, and hopefully turn a profit, but also make the game more fun. Having paid a lot for your one and only life, you will take extra care not to lose it.
